<h2>Don't Misinterpret the Definitions of Slip and Relapse!</h2>
<p>Our primary goal isn't just counting the days; it's to stay away from disobeying Allah and avoid the addictive
	behaviors that have destroyed our lives.</p>
<p><strong>Hello, wonderful people,</strong></p>

<p>I wanted to discuss an important topic regarding the concepts of slips and relapses.</p>

<p>Many people have misunderstood the definitions of slip and relapse.</p>

<p><strong>I say "misunderstood," but it's more about how they dealt with these concepts.</strong></p>

<p>Everyone understands the terms, but some have used them as an excuse to fall into mistakes, thinking that since it's
	not a relapse, they don't need to start counting again from day one!</p>

<p>There are some critical points I'd like to clarify on this matter:</p>

<h3><strong>First: Let's Define Slip, Lapse, and Relapse</strong></h3>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Slip:</strong> A momentary lapse, like looking at an image or a scene and quickly moving away.</li>
	<li><strong>Lapse:</strong> Returning to old habits, such as watching or engaging in inappropriate behaviors without
		abandoning the recovery path, typically only once, and then continuing the recovery journey.</li>
	<li><strong>Relapse:</strong> A full-blown return to old behaviors for an extended period, often several days.</li>
</ul>

<p>The purpose of these definitions is to understand that your brain and recovery aren't as affected by a slip as they
	are by a relapse.</p>

<p><strong>But what's the real issue?</strong></p>

<p>The problem lies in how a recovering individual responds to these definitions.</p>

<p>A negative person might think, "Great, since watching or engaging once isn't considered a relapse but just a slip, I
	can do it and continue on."</p>

<h4><strong>Here's the Danger!</strong></h4>

<ul>
	<li><strong>First:</strong> It's inherently sinful, and deliberately sinning is not permissible. Additionally, it
		trains your brain to give in, weakening your ability to resist temptations.</li>
	<li><strong>Second:</strong> Slips lead to depression, feelings of inferiority and shame, wasted time, and all the
		negative emotions you know follow them.</li>
	<li><strong>Third:</strong> Slips accumulate and can lead to a full relapse, which could last indefinitely.</li>
	<li><strong>Fourth:</strong> Slips delay recovery. If you're not progressing, you're undoubtedly regressing, even if
		it's not by much. You are still falling short of your goal to quit pornography entirely.</li>
	<li><strong>Fifth:</strong> Even a brief glance at an inappropriate image can revive the addiction within you,
		feeding it the "juice" it thrives on. So imagine the impact of repeated slips!</li>
</ul>

<p>We must distinguish between what could happen and what will happen.</p>

<p><strong>Could a slip happen? Yes, it could.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Could a lapse happen? Yes, it could.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Could a relapse happen? Yes, it could.</strong></p>

<p>But if you internally believe that you will inevitably relapse, <strong>that's where the danger lies!</strong> A
	person who fights their enemy with the certainty that they will lose is defeated before even engaging in the battle.
</p>

<p>Therefore, we must not use the possibility of a relapse as an excuse to be weak and give in.</p>

<p><strong>I'm referring to slips at the least.</strong></p>

<p>Do not program your brain to think that slips are inevitable. By doing so, you're setting yourself up for a fall at
	any moment of weakness, convincing yourself that it's just a slip and won't affect your count!</p>

<p>Our primary goal isn't just counting the days; it's to stay away from disobeying Allah and avoid the addictive
	behaviors that have destroyed our lives.</p>

<h3><strong>From Understanding the True Definition of Slip and Relapse, We Learn Important Positive Lessons:</strong>
</h3>

<ul>
	<li><strong>If we fall, we get up quickly and treat it as a lesson to prevent a recurrence of the same
			mistake.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>We don't start counting from day one unless we've deeply engaged in pornography multiple times.</strong>
		This pushes us forward, not backward.</li>
	<li><strong>Positively, we strive to achieve the ultimate goal of complete recovery.</strong> Recovery is only
		possible through total abstinence from pornography, as slips disrupt brain chemistry but quickly stabilize,
		requiring less effort to return to your normal state compared to someone who is newly recovering or has just
		relapsed.</li>
	<li><strong>Positively, view it as a crisis that will pass.</strong> Move on after seeking forgiveness and
		repenting. If you consider every slip a relapse and start counting from the beginning, this can lead many people
		to feel discouraged, and they may even stop recovering altogether due to a misunderstanding of the definition of
		relapse.</li>
</ul>

<p>We must acknowledge that those who succeed in staying away from wrongful behaviors aren't necessarily the ones who
	never experience slips or relapses. They are also the ones who know how to handle them when they occur and get back
	on track.</p>

<p><strong>Someone might ask:</strong> "What's the difference between someone who used to watch pornography once a week,
	repents, and returns again, but doesn't do it daily or for an extended period, and what you're talking about in
	understanding the definition of a slip? If we compare them, we won't find a difference!"</p>

<p>The difference is significant. The former isn't on the path to recovery, doesn't realize they're addicted, and
	doesn't know that they will inevitably experience tolerance, requiring more engagement over time to achieve the same
	pleasure, leading to a deeper decline and more significant downfall. The difference isn't just that they don't know,
	but that they aren't doing anything to recover, such as altering brain pathways and reshaping them through
	systematic recovery programs.</p>

<p><strong>If you can understand the meaning of slip and relapse and deal with them correctly and with a refined
		understanding, you are one of the successful ones.</strong></p>
