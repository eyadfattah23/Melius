	<h1>why do we relapse</h1>
	<h2>Instead of Only Fighting Pornography, Fill Your Mind, Heart, and Life with Good Things</h2>
	<p><strong>These are the things that will truly make your life valuable.</strong></p>

	<h3>“I want to quit pornography, but why do I keep going back to it?”</h3>

	<p>Imagine someone knocks on your door. When you open it, you find a beautiful stranger standing there, offering to
		undress in front of you.</p>

	<p><strong>“What are you saying?! I'm sorry... No, thank you. I'm in a relationship, and this is something I don’t
			feel good about. Please leave,”</strong> you might respond.</p>

	<p>The door closes, and you take a deep breath. An hour later, a different beautiful stranger knocks on the door
		with the same offer, but this time they invite you to watch them have sex with someone else.</p>

	<p><strong>Again and again, day after day, these knocks continue. No matter how many times you say 'no,' the
			invitations to watch an endless 'ocean of sex' keep coming. Easily accessible. Anytime.</strong> Would this
		be hard for anyone to resist? You bet it would, especially for someone seeking freedom from the grip of
		pornography.</p>

	<p><em>Ask anyone living in our time today; this is very much what they face.</em></p>

	<p>Experiencing this test calls for more empathy toward men and women—young and old—who are trying to break free
		from pornography immediately.</p>

	<p>We hope they will leave pornography for something better. But should we be confused about why some people
		struggle to break free from it?</p>

	<h3>“Why do I keep going back to pornography, even though I know better?”</h3>

	<p>Dr. Mark Chamberlain has worked with more people struggling with pornography addiction than perhaps anyone alive.
	</p>

	<p>In a recent interview, Dr. Mark explained why people keep getting drawn back to pornography, despite all the
		tendencies or inclinations tied to the idea that pornography sends a powerful message to our bodies, regardless
		of what people believe in their minds.</p>

	<p>Even when a person is aware of all the reasons to stay away, pornographic content sends a strong and effective
		message to all levels of their minds and bodies: <em>“I see you… I desire you... You are loved, and in fact, I
			trust you so much that I’ll be naked with you.”</em></p>

	<p>All these messages are powerful physiologically: <strong>“To have another human love us, want us, trust us,
			approve of us, and be pleased with us—that's all connected to our internal system and helps us connect with
			other humans.”</strong></p>

	<p>The constant, steady invitation to watch pornography makes it feel like a legitimate means of distraction from
		the pressures of real life around you. Simply put, a brain consumed by pornography cannot distinguish between
		the enticing fantasy it presents and an invitation from a real person.</p>

	<h3>What Does All This Mean?</h3>

	<p>There are emotional reasons why people return to pornography, reasons that aren’t crazy or abnormal. Reasons that
		don’t make them a “bad person.” <strong>We all need connection, we all need to belong and feel loved.</strong>
		And pornography consumers have been deceived into believing that pornography provides them with all of the
		above.</p>

	<p>But the hardest part is that pornography doesn’t provide that, not even close.</p>

	<p>In fact, every time someone responds to these invitations and welcomes pornography into their lives, it leads
		them to feel less connected and loved (even if others try to seek that with them).</p>

	<p>This is one of the big explanations for the importance of mental health and the psychological effects of
		pornography.</p>

	<p><strong>As documented in Gary Wilson’s book, *Your Brain on Porn*, more than 85 studies have linked pornography
			to mental-emotional health impairments and cognitive decline, with over 80 other studies linking pornography
			consumption to less satisfaction in relationships and sex.</strong></p>

	<p><em>Don’t just take my word for it—go and check out the numerous studies on the same topic. And if you’re someone
			struggling with pornography, compare the findings with your own experiences in this matter.</em></p>

	<h3>You Won’t Always Crave Pornography</h3>

	<p>The good news in this context is that this effect has two sides. If pornography indeed erodes mental health and
		relationship quality, then growth in freedom from pornography responds by enhancing the previously mentioned
		areas. <strong>And this feeling is good as you distance yourself from these materials.</strong></p>

	<p>Soon enough, pornography will become like an ex-lover—a nuisance you should stay away from for the sake of your
		mental health. And because life without pornography is simply much better.</p>

	<p><strong>So, when these invitations knock on your door again, you will know what to say and how to keep the door
			closed until you're ready for something much better.</strong></p>
