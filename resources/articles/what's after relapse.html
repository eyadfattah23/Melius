<h2>What If You Relapse?</h2>

<p><strong>Nothing will be achieved if you drown yourself in sorrow after a relapse, and there is no reason to delay
		starting again to rebuild what you've previously accomplished.</strong> If you refuse to start moving, you're
	closer to doing something much harder: giving up!</p>

<p><strong>Joey Dallas</strong> from <em>Covenant Eyes</em> says:</p>

<h3>“Relapse” means “a deterioration after a period of improvement.”</h3>

<p>It is an enemy to be avoided, as it makes life difficult when it happens. But in the long run, those who successfully
	recover from pornography are not necessarily people who have never relapsed before; they are people who know how to
	control their relapse after it occurs, return to the path of recovery, and prevent relapse from happening again.</p>

<p><strong>Anytime you try to make a positive change, you are prone to relapse.</strong> Anyone who has tried to stick
	to a diet, quit smoking, or stop a bad habit can confirm this.</p>

<p><em>Striving and struggling for the better means you are at risk of returning to the old days you don’t want,</em> as
	we humans tend to return to patterns ingrained in us that we have been accustomed to for a period of time.</p>

<p>We automatically return to what is familiar. This is a painful reality, especially for the person who has moved away
	from pornography and is struggling to stay on the path of recovery. They must accept the fact that they will be
	exposed to triggers that push them to relapse from the first day of quitting, and this means they need to
	<strong>always expect relapse!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Relapse is always possible, but it is not inevitable.</strong> Expecting relapse doesn’t mean you’re planning
	to relapse! No, that’s not the meaning. Although failure is possible, it is not inevitable. So, expecting relapse
	means you consider what could happen, not what will happen.</p>

<p>So, you don’t have to go back to watching pornography. Absolutely not. But in case you do, here are some steps you
	should take immediately:</p>

<h3>First, Tell an Accountability Partner:</h3>

<p><strong>Decide now, who will you tell in case you relapse?</strong> An accountability partner is usually someone you
	feel comfortable talking to, who pushes you to stick to your decision to remain balanced and chaste. It could be a
	close friend who knows how to help you.</p>

<p>You can also seek help, for example, from a friend in the recovery group "Free Yourself" on Telegram, which is our
	group. The important thing is to decide who you will tell if you relapse.</p>

<p><strong>Tell them what happened, and that you want their prayers and support.</strong> There is a powerful impact in
	that, perhaps more than you can imagine. A problem that you reveal and bring to light is one you can deal with and
	solve. But what is kept in the dark remains uncorrected.</p>

<h3>Second, Analyze the Situation:</h3>

<p>After informing your accountability partner and receiving their support, you need to understand what went wrong. I
	believe most relapses aren’t mysterious. They usually happen because the person neglected their prayers, or didn’t
	care about the path of recovery, or because of the company they keep, among other possible reasons.</p>

<p>Spend some time reviewing what you did before the relapse, what you could have done differently, and what you will do
	to avoid it in the future.</p>

<h3>Finally, Take Action!</h3>

<p><strong>Return to your path of recovery immediately.</strong> This means repenting, praying, and confessing your sin
	to your Lord in your prayer.</p>

<p><em>Always remember the words of Allah:</em></p>

<p><strong>“And it is He who accepts repentance from His servants and pardons misdeeds, and He knows what you do.”
		[Ash-Shura 25]</strong></p>

<p>This also means taking the necessary steps to prevent yourself from relapsing again, and trying to learn from the
	relapse.</p>

<p>Then, <strong>move on!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Nothing will be achieved if you drown yourself in sorrow after a relapse,</strong> and there is no reason to
	delay starting again to rebuild what you've previously accomplished. If you refuse to start moving, you’re closer to
	doing something much harder: giving up!</p>

<p><strong>The sin you committed can be repented from,</strong> but if you give in to despair, you’re destroying
	yourself.</p>

<p>You are protecting a treasure when you protect your chastity. So know that it’s an ongoing journey, just like
	protecting anything valuable. By knowing the value of your chastity, you will work hard to preserve it and prevent
	anything that threatens it.</p>
