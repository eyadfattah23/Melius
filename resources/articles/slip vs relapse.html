	<h1>Slips vs. Relapses: Understanding the Difference</h1>
	<p>There is a common and incorrect understanding in the recovery journey from pornography and its effects, revolving
		around the concepts of <span class="highlight">slips</span> and <span class="highlight">relapses</span>.</p>

	<h2>What is a Slip?</h2>
	<p>A <span class="highlight">slip</span> is a minor, accidental event, not a full-blown relapse into excessive
		pornography use. Slips:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Are a natural part of the recovery journey.</li>
		<li>Have less severe negative consequences compared to relapses.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>What is a Relapse?</h2>
	<p>A <span class="highlight">relapse</span> starts with a slip but continues over a longer period—perhaps several
		days—where the individual gives in and returns to old habits. Relapses:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Have a harmful impact on recovery plans and mental and physical well-being.</li>
		<li>Can also affect one's psychological state.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Turning Setbacks into Successes</h2>
	<p>During your recovery journey, you will experience both victories and setbacks. Use those setbacks as fuel to
		achieve greater success and accomplishment in your recovery.</p>
	<p><span class="highlight">“What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.”</span></p>

	<h2>How to Learn from Slips</h2>
	<p>Learn how to document your experiences. Understand that a relapse often stems from a slip. The key to preventing
		a slip from becoming a relapse is to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Learn from the slip and avoid the triggers that led to it.</li>
		<li>Immediately after a slip, be honest with yourself. Write down:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Your state before the slip occurred.</li>
			<li>Your daily routine on that day.</li>
			<li>The factors that led you to slip again.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>By identifying these factors, you can become stronger and better equipped to handle triggers that lead to
			slips and prevent them from becoming relapses.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Understanding the Consequences of Relapses</h2>
	<p>Relapses often result from a disruption in lifestyle, causing the individual to escape reality into pornography.
		The effects of a relapse include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Feelings of depression, frustration, anxiety, and anger—emotions the person was trying to escape through
			pornography.</li>
		<li>Sometimes, after a relapse, individuals may even contemplate suicide.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Key Differences</h2>
	<p><span class="highlight">A slip</span> is a temporary setback and usually happens once. <span class="highlight">A
			relapse</span> is a repeated return to previous behaviors over an extended period.</p>
	<p><span class="highlight">Do not handle the definitions of slips and relapses incorrectly!</span> Address your slip
		before it leads to a relapse and avoid falling back into the dark tunnel of pornography. Learn from it to
		improve your recovery plan.</p>
	<p>No matter how many slips you experience, do not despair. Quickly get back on track and continue your recovery
		journey. Fill the void left by pornography with worship, exercise, or hobbies. Work on developing yourself in
		all areas of your life.</p>

	Surah Zumar Ayat 53 in Arabic Text
	۞قُل يَٰعِبَادِيَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَسرَفُواْ عَلَىٰٓ أَنفُسِهِم لَا تَقنَطُواْ مِن رَّحمَةِ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ
	يَغفِرُ ٱلذُّنُوبَ جَمِيعًا إِنَّهُ هُوَ ٱلغَفُورُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ</h3>

<h3 class="highlight">Say, “O My servants who have transgressed against themselves [by sinning], do not despair of the
	mercy of Allah.
	Indeed, Allah forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful. [39:53 Quran]”</h3>
