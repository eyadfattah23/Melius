## Motivation & Inspiration üí°

The idea behind Melius started from a personal experience with a close friend struggling with porn addiction. Watching this friend battle the addiction and trying different solutions without success motivated the team to create something that addresses the root of the problem in a more effective and compassionate way. We believe that privacy, community support, and easily accessible tools are crucial to overcoming this challenge. With this passion, the Melius team is dedicated to helping others take control of their lives.

Melius has grown into more than just a technical project. It‚Äôs a tool built with empathy, a product of deep thought and a desire to make a real difference in people‚Äôs lives.


## Technical Overview üõ†Ô∏è

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the technology stack and architectural decisions:

### Frontend

- **React:** The frontend is powered by React for efficient UI rendering and easy state management.
- **Tailwind:** The CSS framework used for styling and layout.
- **shadcn/ui:** A collection of UI components and utilities for building web applications.

### Backend
- **Flask (Python):** Chosen for its lightweight nature, Flask allowed us to build out APIs quickly while maintaining flexibility.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** Authentication is handled with JWT to ensure that user sessions are stateless and secure.
- **MySQL:** Used for efficient storage of user progress and logs, chosen for its scalability and robustness.
  

### Key Algorithms and Solutions üß†

One of the core challenges I encountered was [describe a key technical challenge]. After a few iterations, I chose to implement [solution or algorithm]. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of how it works:

```kotlin
// Example of the core algorithm or solution in Kotlin
fun calculateOrderTotal(order: List<OrderEntry>): Double {
    return order.sumOf { it.quantity * it.price }
}
```


## Features üõ†Ô∏è

- **Anonymous Account Creation**: Users can sign up without sharing personal information.
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor your progress over time and gain achievements the longer you stay on track.
- **Resource Hub**: Access articles, videos, and exercises to support recovery.
- **Community Support**: Engage with a like-minded community to share experiences and encourage one another.
- **Privacy Protection**: Data security is a top priority, ensuring anonymity at all stages.


## Challenges and Solutions ü§î

While building **Project Name**, I faced several obstacles that pushed me to find creative solutions:

-   **Challenge 1: Offline Support**\
    The app needed to function offline due to [mention real-world scenario, like warehouse operations]. I solved this by [explain your solution, e.g., caching data, storing it locally].

-   **Challenge 2: Handling Large Data Sets**\
    When dealing with large product inventories, the app started slowing down. I optimized this by [describe how you improved performance, e.g., using pagination, lazy loading].

Each of these challenges helped me grow in [mention specific technical or soft skills, like debugging, performance tuning, or problem-solving].

##  Future Enhancements üöÄ

Here's what I plan for the next iteration of **Project Name**:

-   **Integrating Payment Gateways:** To allow users to complete purchases seamlessly, I plan to add [describe specific payment APIs or gateways].
-   **Improved UI/UX:** I envision [describe any UX improvements based on feedback or personal ideas].
-   **Enhanced Security:** Implementing [mention additional authentication methods, encryption, etc.].

There's always room to refine and evolve this project, and I'm excited about future possibilities.
